# taskManager
this is a project I made just for fun.

## Microsoft is not able to create a searchbar into the existing Task Manager
so I made it...

**Feel free to modify and use**

## by the way...
* I didn't know how to upload a compiled version so...
* Download [AHK](https://www.autohotkey.com/download/ahk-install.exe)
* Donwload the [taskManager.ahk](https://github.com/fenchai23/taskManager/blob/master/TaskManager.ahk) script and Run.
* ...or if you are lazy get the [compiled](https://www.dropbox.com/s/gl5l9j505udcecj/TaskManager.exe?dl=1) version! *(it's hosted by dropbox, so I might forget about it and delete it someday lol)* and just **run**.
