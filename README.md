# taskManager
this is a project I made just for fun.

## Microsoft is not able to create a searchbar into the existing Task Manager
so I made it...


### Feel free to modify and use

## by the way...
* I didn't know how to upload a compiled version so...
* Download [AHK](https://www.autohotkey.com/download/ahk-install.exe)
* Donwload the [taskManager.ahk](https://github.com/fenchai23/taskManager/blob/master/TaskManager.ahk) script and Run.
